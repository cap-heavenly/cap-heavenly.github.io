**Why was this started?:**                                                                                                                                                                                       
I began this originally to learn how to use github, however I am now using this to document my progress in teaching myself HTML, JavaScript, CSS and front-end development.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                
**How can I be contacted?:**

My name is Charlie (she/they) and I'm a student trying to teach herself software development. I am fairly knowledgable in basic python, althought I do not know much about common modulesand how to utilise them, I know the most basic HTML and I know very little CSS.

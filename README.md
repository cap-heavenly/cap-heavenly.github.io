I began this originally to learn how to use github, however I am now using this to document my progress in teaching myself HTML, CSS and front-end development.

My name is Charlie (she/they) and I'm a student trying to teach herself software development. I am fairly knowledgable in basic python, althought I do not know much about common modules and how to utilise them, I know the most basic HTML and I know very little CSS.
